// Informal "goodbyes"
All right then
Bye!
Have a good one
I must be going
I've got to get going
Later
See you
See you later
See you soon
Take it easy
Talk to you later
So long

// Formal "goodbyes"
Farewell
Good night
Goodbye
Have a good day
Have a good evening
Have a good night
Have a good week
Have a good weekend
Have a nice day
Have a nice evening
Have a nice night
Have a nice week
Have a nice weekend
It was nice meeting you
It was nice seeing you
It was nice to see you again
Take care
Until tomorrow
Until next week
